# BeyondFL

BeyondFL is an open-source successor to Flash API based on the powerful OpenFL library. While OpenFL aims to seamlessly integrate the Flash API 1:1 for multiple targets in haxe, BeyondFL seeks to improve upon the Flash API and provide entirely new features, tools, performance enhancements and ease of use.
